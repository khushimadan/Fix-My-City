## Methodology
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Identify key features (user login, complaint logging, admin dashboard).
2. **UI/UX Design**: Create interactive prototypes using Figma.
3. **Frontend Development**: Build app interface using Flutter and Dart.
4. **Backend Setup**: Use Firebase Firestore for database management and Firebase Storage for image storage.
5. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train an ML model (MobileNetV2) with TensorFlow to estimate workforce requirements based on complaint photos.
6. **Testing**: Perform unit testing and integration testing using Flutter testing libraries.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy on Play Store and App Store, integrate GitHub for version control.
8. **Feedback & Iteration**: Gather user feedback and refine the app based on input.
